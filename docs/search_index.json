Our website is built upon the popular python web-framework Flask. The main reason as to why we make use of an external framework such as Flask, is to maintain security by using a much used, respected and documented framework that has already been tried and tested by many industry professionals. It also has packages for all the functionality that is needed to make a functional website for many different types of applications, providing tools such as session-handling, easy database management and more. 1.1 Encryption and hashing For hashing, we elected to use Scrypt over alternatives such as bcrypt and argon2. While we had initially planned on using bcrypt we quickly realized that wouldnâ€™t be as good as the alternatives due to certain security flaws, and critically also the password length. From there it was an abritrary choice between argon2 and scrypt. 1.2 Site structure Our sitemap looks like this. The only websites available without any form of authentication is the front page and register pages. From the register page we also render another html within the same route to register to verify the users 2FA-token, as they need to get their 2FA token set up to even log in at all.
