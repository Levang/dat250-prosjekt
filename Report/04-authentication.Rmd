# Authentication

Authentication of the registered user is required for the following actions:
  - login
  - transfer of money
  - creation of bank account
  - deletion of bank account
  - deletion of user
  
In order to make verification easy to maintain we use the same verification function across the site.
The only exception is during registration, where the information is being generated.
This function takes user input and verifies it. It also syncs the users information stored in redis with the database.

```python
def verifyUser(email, password, addToActive=False):
  # hash the email
  if email is None:
      hashed_email = current_user.email
  else:
      hashed_email = flask_scrypt.generate_password_hash(email, "")

  # create user class with information from database
  userDB = User.query.filter_by(email=hashed_email).first()

  # if the user doesnt exist in database
  if userDB is None:
      return False, None, None

  # format password from database
  DBpw = userDB.password.encode('utf-8')

  # check if the hashed email is the same as the one in the database,
  #just a double check.
  # Strictly not necessary, but just seems logical to do.
  emailOK = hashed_email.decode('utf-8') == userDB.email.decode('utf-8')

  # Verify that the password is correct
  pwOK = flask_scrypt.check_password_hash(password.encode('utf-8'), DBpw[:88],
         DBpw[88:176])

  # If the password is correct and email exists in the database
  if emailOK and pwOK:

      # Decrypt the users encryption key
      decryptKey = decrypt(password, userDB.enKey.encode('utf-8'), True)

      # Decrypt the secret key
      secret_key = decrypt(decryptKey, userDB.secret.encode('utf-8'))

      if addToActive:
          # sync redis with database! This is a function.
          redis_sync(decryptKey, hashed_email)

      return True, userDB, secret_key

  return False, None, None
```
