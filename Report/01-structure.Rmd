# Structure

To structure our website we make use of a number of various frameworks and tools to make everything work securely. Our website is built upon the popular python web-framework Flask. The main reason as to why we make use of an external framework such as Flask, is to maintain security by using a much used, respected and documented framework that has already been tried and tested by many industry professionals. It also has packages for all the functionality that is needed to make a functional website for many different types of applications, providing tools such as session-handling, easy database management and more.

## Encryption and hashing
For hashing, we elected to use Scrypt over alternatives such as bcrypt and argon2. While we had initially planned on using bcrypt we quickly realized that wouldn't be as good as the alternatives due to certain security flaws, and critically also the password length. From there it was an abritrary choice between argon2 and scrypt.
