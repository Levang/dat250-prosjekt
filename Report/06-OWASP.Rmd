## Sensitive Data Exposure
In the development cycle of our website, we have attempted to always keep security in mind. This of course includes encrypting sensitive data, aswell as attempting to handle it as little as possible. This is essential in keeping up with security. The less information we need to handle, the better it is for us, the user, and the security on our website.

### Data Classification
To accomplish our goals for security we have broadly defined what data is sensitive. While all data is somewhat sensitive, and we'd much rather nothing be exposed to anyone ever. The truth however is always that we have to prepare for the worst case scenario. To this end we have a broad idea of what data is critical (personal information, passwords etc) and what data is less sensitive. Check our write-up on databases in chapter \ref{databases} for more details on how the data we store is handled.

### Implementation
The thing most important for us to keep in mind when developing our website is that we ideally don't want to handle user data more than simple checks and comparisons (such as password) for verification. When handling the data for a specific form, we do what we need with that data then and there, and then always immediately discard it. Data that is not retained can not be stolen. 

The data we have to store that is sensitive is all cryptographically hashed, using a variety of Fernet and scrypt. In other words, our entire user table in our database is encrypted to some degree. Other information is not as sensitive as it is not personal information, and cannot be edited. A malicious actor knowing account-numbers and associated balances wouldn't make a difference as they wouldn't be able to do anything with it. Passwords are stored as a scrypt hash with a random salt, with the possibility of having a work factor (delay variable) to it, so that it takes longer to brute-force passwords. Our random encryption key for various things is also encrypted using fernet and the users hashed password, meaning we can only decrypt data when given the users password, adding an extra layer of security.

As for data in transit we have added the HTTPS protocol to our server to make it exponentially more difficult to do an attack on data in transit. Amongst other things this more or less eliminates the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack. When handling our users data, although encrypted we should always do what we can to make it as difficult as possible.

As an added security feature we have also disabled caching on all our sites. This to prevent users from being able to just click "back" and find sensitive data, and also to prevent certain attacks.
